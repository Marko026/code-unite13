# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI question/answer generation feature in DevOverFlow is currently failing with a "Service Status: CLOSED" error message. This indicates that the circuit breaker has been triggered due to repeated API failures, preventing users from generating AI-powered answers. The system shows "Unexpected Error" with a "Try Again" button, but the service remains unavailable. This feature is critical for helping users get quick, intelligent responses to programming questions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using DevOverFlow, I want to be able to generate AI-powered answers to questions so that I can get intelligent suggestions and save time writing responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the "Generate AI Answer" button THEN the system SHALL make a successful API call to OpenAI
2. WHEN the API call is successful THEN the system SHALL display the generated answer in the TinyMCE editor
3. WHEN the API call fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining what went wrong
4. WHEN I generate an AI answer THEN the system SHALL show a loading state during the API call
5. IF the OpenAI API key is missing THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate configuration error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see clear feedback when AI generation fails so that I can understand what went wrong and potentially retry the operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information to the console
2. WHEN a network error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
3. WHEN the OpenAI quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL display a specific quota error message
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide a retry button if the error is recoverable
5. WHEN the circuit breaker is open THEN the system SHALL disable the generate button and show appropriate messaging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI generation feature to work reliably across different browsers and network conditions so that I can depend on it consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the feature in different browsers THEN it SHALL work consistently
2. WHEN there are temporary network issues THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry logic
3. WHEN the TinyMCE editor fails to load THEN the system SHALL fall back to a plain text editor
4. WHEN storage quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL clear unnecessary data and continue functioning
5. WHEN the API response is malformed THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to be able to monitor and debug AI generation issues so that I can maintain the service effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them with sufficient detail for debugging
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL track success/failure rates
3. WHEN configuration issues exist THEN the system SHALL provide clear diagnostic information
4. WHEN the service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide tools to test API connectivity
