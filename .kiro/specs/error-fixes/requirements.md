# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical application errors that are preventing proper functionality of the Code Unite platform. The errors include resource quota exceeded issues, TinyMCE editor configuration problems, and CORS policy violations that block API communication. These fixes are essential for maintaining a functional user experience and ensuring proper editor and API functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle resource quotas properly, so that I don't encounter quota exceeded errors that break functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application encounters resource quota limits THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
2. WHEN storage operations are performed THEN the system SHALL validate data size before attempting to store
3. IF quota limits are approached THEN the system SHALL provide user feedback and alternative options
4. WHEN quota exceeded errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the error and gracefully degrade functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the TinyMCE editor to be fully functional and editable, so that I can create and edit content without restrictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TinyMCE editors are initialized THEN the system SHALL configure them as editable by default
2. WHEN users interact with the editor THEN the system SHALL allow full editing capabilities
3. IF read-only mode is required THEN the system SHALL explicitly set it based on user permissions or context
4. WHEN editor configuration is applied THEN the system SHALL ensure proper toolbar and functionality access

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want API calls to work properly without CORS errors, so that I can use all application features that depend on API communication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes API requests THEN the system SHALL include proper CORS headers in responses
2. WHEN API endpoints are accessed from the deployed domain THEN the system SHALL allow cross-origin requests
3. IF CORS preflight requests are made THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate headers
4. WHEN API calls fail due to CORS THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error logging and monitoring, so that I can identify and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them with sufficient detail for debugging
2. WHEN API failures happen THEN the system SHALL capture request/response information
3. IF client-side errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement proper error boundaries
4. WHEN errors are logged THEN the system SHALL include timestamp, user context, and stack trace information
